    <p className="about__text" data-aos="fade-up" > My name is Mohammed Kemal and I am a Full Stack Web Developer located in Washington DC. I like building websites that incorporate new technologies while maintaining high usability. I program primarily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with Wordpress, Octave, and various DSP languages. I am a massive audiophile who likes working with sounds whether it be mixing records, sound design, or producing songs. Needless to say, I am always within arms reach of a computer. </p>
